# Day-19

## Building the Snake Game:
Day 1:
- Create a Snake Body
- Move Snake Body
- Control the Snake

Day 2:
- Detect Collision and food
- Create a scoreboard
- Detect collision with wall
- Detect Collision with tail.

## Day-1
Today we made the snake body move in directions.
To actually have a seamless movement of snake we need to use time.sleep() and screen.update()
