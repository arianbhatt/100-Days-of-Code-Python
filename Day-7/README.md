## Functions with inputs

```python
def my_function(something'Parameter'):
	#Do this with something
	#Then do this
	#Finally
my_function(send_something'Argument')
```
Parameter is the name of the data that is passed.
Argument is the data that is passed.
These were Positional Arguments when more than one they just get assigned according to the position.

Keyword Arguments, we can change the position or sequence in which we send the arguments as long as we define which is which.
example:
```pyhton
def greet_with_name(name,location)
	print(f"Hello {name}")
	print(f"what is it like in {location}")
greet_with_name(location="Mars",name="Elon")
```
We made a Caesar Cipher in this exercise it was nice.
