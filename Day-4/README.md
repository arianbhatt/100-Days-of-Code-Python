# Day-4

## Python Loops

In python we have for loop, while loop, do while.
```python
fruits=["Apple","Peach","Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)
```
This will loop through the list of fruits and fruit will hold the values.

### for Loop in Range
```python
for number in range(a,b):
	print(num)
```
the above loop will print all number from a to b (excluding b)

in python while loop is used when number of times is not known or we have to do a task until a certain condition is fulfilled.
```python
while(condition):
	statements
