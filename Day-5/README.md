# Day-5

## Functions

We get our code to do different functionality. Enables code reusability.
Python comes with a lot of in-built funtions.
examples: print() len() etc.
Creating a function
```python
def my_function():
	statements
# to execute a function we have to call it
my_function()
```
We practice on Reeborg's World by using functions provided to create personalised functions.

## Indentation
In Python Indentation is very Important.
four spaces per indent according to Python3 docs

## while loop
will continue until a condition is true.
```python
while something_is_true:
	Do Something
```
if something_is_true never becomes false.
It becomes a infinite loop.
