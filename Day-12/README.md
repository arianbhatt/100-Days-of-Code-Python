# Day-12

## Debugging 
Removing Bugs from our code.

Process:
- Describe the Problem
- Reproduce the Bug
- Play Computer
- Fix the Errors
- Print is your friend
- Use a Debugger
- Take a Break
- Ask a friend (if you have, or hop onto any discord)
- Run the code often
- Ask on Stackoverflow (don't go unless serious or unique)
