# Day-17

## Python Turtle
Read the Docs to get an idea of the methods of the class.

## Modules
We import stuff in python
```python
import turtle # module imported
from turtle import Turtle # Turtle class imported 
from turtle import * # everything imported but bad code
# we can also alias the modules
import turtle as t
shiro=t.Turtle()
```
## tuple
datatype in python.
(1,2,3) list with round brackets(almost).
a Tuple is immutable.
to change we can convert a tuple to list.
list(tuple)

# Art Project
